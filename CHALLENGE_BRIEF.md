# Challenge Brief

As the next step in the interview process, we have created this coding challenge to assess your coding skills. The take-home coding challenge is expected to take a few hours to complete.

In the email, you will find a zip file containing an assorted collection of images and a CSV file with columns denoting the image file name and its corresponding caption. From these image-caption pairs, we would like you to design a solution that computes a similarity metric between the images and texts.

Specifically, we ask that you complete the following:

1. Develop some code to compute the similarity metric for each image-text pair and save it in an additional column in the given CSV file.
2. Briefly discuss the time and memory footprint of computing the similarity metric. What strategies could you use to optimise the time and/or memory performance of the code?
3. Explain how your application could be packaged and deployed to handle hundreds of millions of daily requests.

Please return your submission by responding to this email with an attached zip file containing only your code (python .py files) addressing 1 and a README.md file discussing your design considerations and addressing 2 and 3.

This challenge is purposefully open-ended, and you can make any design decisions. You are welcome to use any Python libraries or GitHub repos where you see fit. Please document any design considerations as comments in the README file where appropriate.
