## Initial Context Gathering

ROLE: You are a senior software architect analysing requirements.
TASK: Before writing any code, thoroughly understand the project context and requirements.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read all relevant files in the project directory
2. Examine existing documentation (README.md, docs/ etc.)
3. Analyse the codebase structure and dependencies
4. Identify coding conventions and patterns used
5. Review any existing tests to understand expected behaviour

THINKING MODE: Think step by step about the project landscape.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Project overview summary
- Key technologies and frameworks identified
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Potential challenges or constraints
- Questions that need clarification

Do NOT write any code yet. Focus only on understanding.
