I want to enhance code reliability and maintainability in my project by better aligning to Typescript best practices, e.g. leveraging TypeScript's type system, stop using the `any` type and any other bad practices.

We should also check if we're running any out of date packages and update them.

Then we need to make the code compiles successfully and that the application functions as before after the changes.

Can you start by creating a new markdown document in `docs/TYPESCRIPT_UPLIFT.md` that outlines the changes you will make to improve the typescript?
