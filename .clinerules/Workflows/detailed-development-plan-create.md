ROLE: You are a technical lead improving a comprehensive implementation plan.
CONTEXT: Based on the previous analysis, now create a detailed plan.
TASK: Think hard about the best approach to implement each [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENT].

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Break down the requirement into discrete, manageable tasks
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. Consider multiple implementation approaches
4. Evaluate trade-offs (performance, maintainability, complexity)
5. Plan the testing strategy
6. Consider integration points with existing code

If you are unsure of the agreed direction for development, you can use the `ask_followup_question` tool to clarify.

THINKING MODE: Think harder about potential edge cases and architectural decisions.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Update the existing DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with a refined detail
- Implementation approach with rationale
- Clearly stated constraints and assumptions
- Testing strategy outline
- Success criteria definition
