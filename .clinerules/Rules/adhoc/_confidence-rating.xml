    Rate your understanding on a scale of 0-10 before proceeding:
  </mandatory_confidence_scoring>
  <confidence_levels>
    <insufficient_knowledge>
      0-3 (Insufficient Knowledge)
      - Action Required: Stop immediately. Conduct thorough investigation.
      - Why This Matters: Stop. Proceeding with low confidence risks breaking critical
      business
      workflows, corrupting data integrity, or causing integration failures that affect
      multiple
      downstream systems.
      - Next Steps: Use investigation checklist below, examine relevant code patterns, ask
      specific clarifying questions.
    </insufficient_knowledge>
    <partial_understanding>
      4-6 (Partial Understanding)
      - Action Required: Stop. Significant gaps remain that must be addressed.
      - Why This Matters: Partial understanding often leads to solutions that work in
      isolation
      but fail when integrated with the broader OTP ecosystem.
      - Next Steps: Focus investigation on identified knowledge gaps, validate assumptions
      with
      code examination.
    </partial_understanding>
    <good_understanding>
      7-8 (Good Understanding)
      - Action Required: Stop. Verify edge cases and integration impacts.
      - Why This Matters: Good understanding covers the happy path but may miss critical
      edge
      cases or downstream effects.
      - Next Steps: Review error scenarios, check integration points, validate business
      rule
      completeness.
    </good_understanding>
    <complete_understanding>
      9-10 (Complete Understanding)
      - Action Required: Proceed with implementation.
      - Why This Matters: Complete understanding enables confident implementation with
      proper
      error handling, integration awareness, and business rule compliance.
      - Focus: Execution quality, comprehensive testing, proper documentation.
